# First, let's shoot partial phases. Here we are asking to start shooting on April (04) 1st (01) at
# 6PM (18), from minute 1 (01) till 11 (11). Shots will be taken every minute, so in total we will
# get 11 firings of the script responsible for the partial phases of the eclipse.
# Note: '>>' tells the cron to store the output in the provided file. '2>&1' tells the cron to redirect
# all errors into the main stream of messages (Unix-alike systems splits normal and error messages).

# Next, we want to shoot Baily's Beads and totality. We invoke the corresponding script on
# April (04) 1st (01) at 6PM (18), at 13th minute mark. We gave here ~2 minute delay after the last
# partial shooting. Depending on the eclipse timing, you might want to set it longer, at 3 or even
# 4 minutes. It must enough for the user to remove the filter from the camera and allow the script
# to prepare the camera for the upcominbg shooting.

# Lastly, shoot partial phases after C3. Here we are asking to start shooting on April (04) 1st (01) at
# 6PM (18), from minute 17 (17) till 27 (27). Shots will be taken every minute, so in total we will
# get 11 firings of the script responsible for the partial phases of the eclipse.
