# ---------- Sony A7 III ----------

# First, let's shoot partial phases. Here we are asking to start shooting on April (04) 1st (01) at
# 6PM (18), from minute 1 (01) till 11 (11). Shots will be taken every minute, so in total we will
# get 11 firings of the script responsible for the partial phases of the eclipse.
# Note: '>>' tells the cron to store the output in the provided file. '2>&1' tells the cron to redirect
# all errors into the main stream of messages (Unix-alike systems splits normal and error messages).

# Next, we want to shoot Baily's Beads and totality. We invoke the corresponding script on
# April (04) 1st (01) at 6PM (18), at 13th minute mark. We gave here ~2 minute delay after the last
# partial shooting, just to be safe. The eclipse will happen at 15th minute mark, so we have yet
# another safe gap, which will allow us to remove the solar filter and the script to configure camera.
# Note: we are using here helper script '2_copy_to_shm_v1.sh' to aleviate the slow main
# storage of the system (Raspberry Pi running from SD card). In case you are running from NVMe
# then there should be no need for it and you can invoke '1_sony_totality_usb_v1.sh' instead.

# Lastly, shoot partial phases after C3. Here we are asking to start shooting on April (04) 1st (01) at
# 6PM (18), from minute 19 (19) till 29 (29). Shots will be taken every minute, so in total we will
# get 11 firings of the script responsible for the partial phases of the eclipse.

# ---------- Sony A7S II ----------

# First, let's shoot partial phases. Here we are asking to start recordings on April (04) 1st (01) at

# get 11 firings of the script responsible for the partial phases of the eclipse.

# Video recording will start as soon as the camera is configured by the script, so keep that in
# mind when setting the video duration. Don't forget to take off the solar filter before that!
